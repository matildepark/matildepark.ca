<h1 class="h1-title">curriculum vitae</h1>

I'm a software and interactive media developer. My professional work outside video games has been focused on product work in experimental areas and creating developer onboarding tools. My narrative work emphasised formal experimentation with computer interfaces.

### freelance work

- **[Tlon Corporation](https://tlon.io)**, June 2019 - Present

From June 2019 to March 2020 I was a front-end developer on the Landscape team. Since April 2020, I lead the Landscape team, organising and executing our product cycles; managing a team scaling between four and six as needed; and serving as a front-end developer.

_Designing and executing userspace software for Urbit, an operating system and peer-to-peer network built from scratch, using React and [Hoon](https://urbit.org/docs/glossary/hoon/)._

_I've also also [written](https://urbit.org/blog/tools-of-our-own/) on the project; given talks regarding our interface and our design principles; lead and participate in communications and product sprints internally several times per year; and represent the project at conferences._
