<h1 class="h1-title">curriculum vitae</h1>

I'm a software and interactive media developer. My professional work has so far been focused on executing front-end and creating self-contained developer onboarding products. My narrative work emphasises an interest in formal experimentation across computer interfaces and recontextualising experience into components of the posthuman.

### freelance work

- **[Tlon Corporation](https://tlon.io)**, June 2019 - Present

_Designing and executing userspace software for Urbit, an operating system and peer-to-peer network built from scratch, using React and [Hoon](https://urbit.org/docs/glossary/hoon/). I also [write](https://urbit.org/blog/landscape-a-portrait/) and present talks when required regarding the operating system, user interface, and our design theory more generally; participate in communications and product sprints internally several times per year, and represent the project at conferences._

_Recently I executed a redesign for all Urbit websites in late 2019. When needed, I serve as a general developer for projects in other departments._
