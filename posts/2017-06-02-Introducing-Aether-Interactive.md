What is [Aether Interactive](http://www.aether.in.net)?

<center><img src="/img/wordmark.png"/></center>

Do you mean *literally*? Well, in that case, Aether Interactive began as a throwaway name for a 1990s JRPG company that me and [Penelope](http://wonderbreath.neocities.org) came up with.

After [Arc Symphony](https://aetherinteractive.itch.io/arc-symphony) came out, it became apparent that people who liked our interactive were interested in continuing the mythology through physical goods: stickers, apparel, more fake jewel cases ... however, as an artist producing and selling physical goods, I had no idea how to navigate the tax system in Ontario.

After some consultation it became apparent that founding a business would be beneficial for tax purposes regarding the production of my interactives as well as related physical paraphernalia for potential sale. Separating my personal expenses and income from a business just made prudent sense.

As I began forming Aether Interactive, however, I also found it to be a valuable opportunity to express what it is I aim for when I create; to draft up a mission for works under the Aether banner as well as a potential base for a future collective with likeminded contributors.

That is, the creation of **empathetic**, **accessible**, and **compassionate** interactives; especially interactives that privilege **deconstruction of nostalgia** in the service of these aims, often including technological analogies to real-world experiences.

Thus Aether lives.

Aether Interactive is a game development company based in Toronto, Ontario. I serve as its all-purpose gynoid. Hooray!
